This is the 2009 Buell 1125CR I just bought (more accurately, I’ve put a deposit on it, but I’ll be paying the balance either this or next week).

It’s got around 7700 miles on it, and is mostly stock. I rode a friend’s 1125CR last summer and loved it - and now it’s my turn to have one.

I may or may not sell the 2008 Blast that I’ve been riding. If the opportunity arises, I’ll sell it for the right price, otherwise I’ll just keep it as a beater.
