A quick post to throw down some random thoughts/updates.

First, on the gym front. Since my last update on this topic, back in early December, I've been going more-or-less every weeknight. My weight hasn't gone down too much, however, I am definitely building muscle, and my body seems to be leaning out a little. Last month, I clocked in at 23.1% body fat - not too terrible, but definitely overweight. My goal is to bring this down a fair bit, and rather than looking at the scale, I've decided to gauge my progress via monthly body fat analysis at my gym. Once spring sets in, towards summer, I'll be spending less time at the gym (to make time for summertime interests) - perhaps 2 or so days a week (albeit, with more intensity during the time spent there).

I'm happy with my progress so far. I'm going to continue training at the gym and pushing myself harder, and keep making attempts to eat healthier. One major health step I've made is to cut soda out of the majority of my diet - instead of being a go-to beverage, it's now a treat to be had once every couple of days (instead of a couple times a day).

Second is the topic of dreaming. Lucid dreaming (or, more accurately, the goal of getting to the point of lucid dreaming) has been a goal of mine for quite some time. At one point, I was keeping a dream log to track my progress, but that didn't end up faring too well. I may take another shot at maintaining a dream log (which would be a separate blog) - stay tuned for details on that.

I've just bought a new motorcycle as well. More details and pics on that will be posted shortly.
