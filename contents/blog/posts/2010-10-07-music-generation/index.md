I am taking an media arts class at school right now. In two weeks, I have an assignment due, some sort of musical composition that involves form. The short of it is that software that generates music via some sort of algorithm is acceptable.

This idea intrigued me when it was mentioned, maybe because I’m a coder (not an artist/composer). My idea is to find some sort of algorithm to auralize various data sources - e.g., the current system clock, the US Debt Clock, the latest trending topics on twitter, or whatever. That is, take a raw bitsream, and… transform it into audio.

The code should be easy to produce once I come up with an algorithm. At any rate, this may be competing with BAFIRC for my time at various points over the next two weeks, but either way, I’ll blog about what I’m working on.
