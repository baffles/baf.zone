I haven’t posted a blog post in a while (almost a year, to be exact). Not sure why - the thought just never seems to cross my mind.

Not much has really happened over the last year. BAFIRC is more or less on the back burner, again. Wooters is in a gross state of neglect. It seems like I lose motivation to work on these things after working 40 hours a week. I did finish up with college, in December of last year, with a bachelor’s degree in computer science. I’ve continued on working at the company I began interning at a few years ago.

I miss programming as a hobby. Coding all day at work really drains on you. I don’t do much when I get home - I wish I did more coding, gaming, and such on my own time. The most gaming I’ve done in a while is playing Gears of War 3 for a while, but even that is something I haven’t done in a few days.

I think I need to start going to the gym. Not only to get into shape, but to give me something beyond computers to focus on, because, frankly, I seem to be losing interest. I’m considering finding something new to go back to school for, and I’m torn with wanting to work less and not wanting to earn less money. I may seriously consider working less and going back to school once I finish paying down my debt. I have around $20,000 or so in student loans, and I owe $9,000 on my car still - once those are gone, we’ll see where I go from there.
