Yeah, it has been a few days since I have made much progress with BAFIRC. I am hoping to be able to implement something useful for it tonight. I still am not totally sure on how I want to lay out my plugin system, so I may just work on fleshing out the DCC code a little more. Either that, or spend some time considering 005 i-support or a different, seemingly more up to date CTCP spec that Sevalecan linked me to.

Anyway, that's about it. I just felt like writing a blog post, so I did so from my phone.
