Thus far, I have just been slacking off and relaxing so far tonight. Played some video games, chatted with people online, and now I am watching TV - the season premiere of Storm Chasers to be exact. BAFIRC is still churning in the back of my mind, but I am just relaxing a bit for now.

Speaking of Storm Chasers, I would love to be a storm chaser one day. Maybe when I semi-retire I'll be able to make if work.
