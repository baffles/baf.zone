Why do I always do this? I have a 6 page paper due tomorrow night at 9PM, and as usual, I keep putting it off as long as humanly possible. I meant to start working on it yesterday. But I didn’t. “Oh, just one more game of UT.” “Oh, just gotta get &lt;x&gt; done first.” Blah, blah, blah. This morning I get up. “I’ll start it at noon.” 12 rolls around and I find something else to do. I end up playing UT for several hours, and where does it leave me? At 6pm, still having done no more than five minutes worth of work on the paper.

And now, I have just finished playing UT, and an email message that someone has started following me has brought me to tumblr. So, what am I doing instead of writing this paper? I’m writing crap on tumblr.

I intend to go start on the paper now. But I can almost guarantee that I won’t for a couple more hours. My parents are almost here, with dinner, so I’m sure that will eat up a couple more hours. Ah, well, nobody will be home for most of tomorrow - maybe I’ll actually get work done then, as long as I can keep myself away from all distractions.
