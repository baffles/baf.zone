I spent a good chunk of the weekend working on the site for SantaHack 2011. It still needs some work, primarily the implementation of the voting mechanism and the assignment and entry info pages. I’ll have plenty of time to do those though, it’s not a ton of work. The important part was getting the base site up and ready.

Major kudos to Mark Oates/Zeox Design as well for all his hard work on the graphics/design for the site.
