I've been doing a horrible job at blogging, as usual. I've gotten a head start on what would have (yet again) been a New Year's resolution - going to the gym. I started going to a local gym with a friend - which is great, it gives somebody to work out with, somebody to be accountable to, etc. So I figured why not get started on what would likely end up being another New Year's resolution - blogging more.

I'd like to attempt to write a blog post every night. That probably won't happen, but it's something to shoot for. Anything at least semi-regular would be nice. Anything goes here, programming, personal stuff, workouts, etc.

As far as the gym - my main goal is to lose some weight and get into shape. Bulking up a little bit is a secondary goal, but nothing I'm going to actively seek at the moment. I seem to have settled in around 200 pounds lately, and I wouldn't mind dropping at least 50 of it (or less, depending on how much muscle I build, being that muscle weighs more than fat).

Wooters.us desperately needs some attention. This seems to be a recurring, tragic issue. It's just hard to find the time to do it - I have so many other things I want to do as well.

And, on a closing note, I think I'm going to host a programming competition this month. I need to get in gear, and set up a site and everything for it, but I'm hoping for moderate success. There seems to be a [void over at allegro.cc](http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/608970) these days with Jakub gone, with nobody left to host ChristmasHack. So I'm planning on organizing â€˜SantaHack' to fill this void. More on that as it comes.
