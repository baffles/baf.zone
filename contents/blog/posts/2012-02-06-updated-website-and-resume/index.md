So, I finally got un-lazy enough to update my website and résumé. It’s been a long time coming, but it’s finally off my todo list.

Of course, the website is mostly overkill at this point anyway. It’s never maintained (I’d rather spend time blogging about projects and such, not that I do that very often either), and is a big wall. I’m actually considering replacing it with a much simpler business-card-style website, which is something a friend was talking about and experimenting with lately.
