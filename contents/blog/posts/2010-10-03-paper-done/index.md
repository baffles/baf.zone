Finally finished and turned in the paper I was [putting off](/blog/posts/2010-10-02-school-work/). That's a weight off my chest now. It's not my best work, but it will do (I hope...).

Economics exam tomorrow night that I need to study for at some point; I'll probably study during the two hour break I have before that class.

Anyhow, time to kick back and watch some TV and write another blog post about something from BAFIRC. I need to design something so I can start coding on it shortly.
