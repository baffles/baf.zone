I try to have a minimal amount of crap on me at any given time. So... what do I have in my pockets right now?

* Keys - car key/fob and a keychain with home/garage/work keys.
* Cell phone - communication, calendar, time, etc.
* Money clip with $40 cash, driver's license, Discover card, debit/ATM card, backup credit card, and movie theater reward card.

That's it. I used to carry a wallet with endless amounts of crap in it, most of which I never need anyhow. I recently made the decision to get a money clip and take only what I use most often, and am liking the results so far.

Occasionally I carry a knife (you never know when it will come in handy), and I've toyed with the idea of buying a pocket-size, high power LED flashlight to carry, but I'm not sure if I'd get enough utility from it to justify carrying it.
