Just giving a quick followup to the last update, my stator re-wind ended up failing. Due to the messiness of some of the windings, one of the wires (one that was way too close to the outsideof the stator) came loose from the epoxy, and started rubbing on the rotor. Eventually it wore right through, leaving quite a mess on my rotor in the process.

I’ve wound a new stator; much more neatly this time, and installed it. I’ve also cleaned up the rotor. I may go back and add some epoxy to one of the abrasions on it at a later point.

I will be posting a complete writeup of my 1125 charging trials and tribulations - stay tuned!
