I didn't end up working on BAFIRC very much today. I got distracted doing some gaming, chatting, visiting with family for a while, eating dinner, etc. Life just got in the way today. I'm not even sure that I will get around to doing any work on it tomorrow.

I have a slight backlog of work that needs to get done. I have a paper to write for a class, and I have some other homework to do for a couple of classes (that I may as well tackle tomorrow, given that I have the day off due to Columbus Day). I've got a few random personal things to do (mailing out a rebate, cleaning up my desk, etc.) as well. So yeah, I intend on beginning tackling these things as soon as I get up, but you know how that goes, I'll probably waste half of the day distracted and end up not getting everything done. But, maybe I'll hit the jackpot of focus, and actually do everything - we'll see.

Beyond that, I'll probably play some Halo Reach or something to relax and unwind a bit. I'm not sure if I'm going to feel like coding (that, and I'm still working on a good design for the plugin system - usually if I let these sorts of things simmer in the back of my mind for a few days, I'll come up with a solution I like).

Anyhow, that's that. I'm going to head to bed and attempt to get up semi-early to begin tackling everything I need to do.
