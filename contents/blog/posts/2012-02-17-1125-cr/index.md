A just finished up the payment and paperwork on my new-to-me 1125CR. Yippie! Now all that remains is getting squared up with DMV (paying sales tax and registration fees, and getting my tag) - always a fun trip to look foward to.

This winter’s been mild. Hopefully it starts getting even warmer soon - once it’s consistently in the 40s-50s in the morning and afternoon during my commute time, I’ll be gladly riding it!
