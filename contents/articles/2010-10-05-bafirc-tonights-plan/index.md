This post is mostly a short plan to myself, but I don’t think I have any pressing school work that needs to be done tonight. Being so, I’d like to get some more code going on BAFIRC.

I plan to finish the IRC connection layer and write a short test to play with it a bit. I will probably borrow a bit from the cbots IRC layer, at least as far as the queue management and connection loop go, just because it’s solid code that’s seen several iterations and works well already. That’s all I’m aiming for tonight though, I don’t want to spend too much time on it. After that, I need to plan out the DCC and CTCP support modules, and begin figuring out the plugin system and API for that. After that, I can begin building the core.

Look for my nightly update/status report later!
