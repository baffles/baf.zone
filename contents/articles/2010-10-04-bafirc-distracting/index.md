BAFIRC is too distracting to think about. During class, I was sketching out the architecture of my irc layer, plugins system, and core/client responsibilities. Yes, sketching on plain old analog paper.

I am posting this now from my phone. A more detailed posting with my thoughts will appear shortly, when I am on my laptop, rather than typing on my phone.
