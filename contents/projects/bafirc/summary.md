BAFIRC is an IRC client. The goal is for it to be almost like a bouncer,
providing functionality similar to what [Quassel] [1] provides.

The current proposed features include (but aren't limited to):
* Centralized backend for a single presence as a continuous client
* DCC file send management
* HTML5 interface, potentially a webkit-embedded based thick app later

The project is ever-evolving, so be sure to pay attention to blog posts about it
for the latest information!

### Development

[![Build Status] [2]] [3]

The full source to BAFIRC is [available on GitHub] [4]! There's also a copy of
the [original incarnation] [5] of BAFIRC from many years ago, for nostalgia
sake. The code itself is pretty incomplete and crappy, so it's not useful for
much at all.
