BAF.Zone is my personal website. You're more than likely on it right now!

The site is statically generated and hosted on Amazon's infrastructure. I'll be
elaborating more in future blog posts, and I'll eventually compile those posts
into a single write-up, so stay tuned!

### Development

The full source to BAF.Zone is [available on GitHub] [1]!
