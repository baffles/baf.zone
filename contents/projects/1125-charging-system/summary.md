The 2009 and 2010 Buell 1125 motorcycles (the 1125R and the 1125CR) are
notorious for their charging system issues. The stator tends to run too hot,
leading to the insulation on the windings breaking down, eventually resulting in
a failed charging system.

One solution to the problem is to downgrade to the 2008 electrical system. I
wanted to avoid doing this, since this results in lower electrical capacity.
Fortunately, there are options available to fix the problem without sacrificing
the higher output of the 2009+ electrical system!
