## About Me

My name is Robert Ferris. I am a full time Software Engineer, holding a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I also hold an Associates Degree in Computer Science from SUNY Adirondack.

## Programming

I have been messing around with programming since I was around 12 years old. I began with a C++ book and, though I
didn't understand all of the concepts at the time, I did learn most of the basics. Shortly thereafter, I found the
[Allegro Game Programming Library](http://www.liballeg.org/), and began messing around with basic game programming.
Since then, I have worked with quite a few languages. Having developed a solid foundation over time, I am able to
pick up new languages fairly easily. After all, most languages are *really* just some new ideas mixed with some new
syntax.

I've worked with server-side software, client-side software, mobile devices, and embedded devices. This includes
the Windows&reg;, Linux, OS X&reg;, Android, and Windows Mobile, and Arduino and PIC devices.

I've dabbled a fair bit in web development as well (could you tell?) &ndash; including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've
worked with Apache, node.js, and IIS. I like CoffeeScript, Jade, and Stylus. I've also been growing fond of Markdown.

As far as tooling, I prefer Visual Studio and TextMate. Git is my source control tool of choice lately.

I try and keep up with hobby programming projects, though this usually falls by the wayside. Unfortunately, I find it
difficult to keep motivation levels up for hobby projects on top of working full time.

## Hobbies

I have several hobbies beyond programming.

### Motorcycling

I'm a budding motorcycle fanatic. I own a couple of motorcycles (presently, a Buell Blast and a Buell 1125CR). I tend
to do all my own mechanical work (with few exceptions) for both my car and my bikes. I enjoy riding &ndash; I usually
ride to work on nice days and take many trips during the nicer seasons (anywhere from driving a few hundred miles for
lunch to multi-week trips). I spend way too much money related to motorcycling (motorcycles, gear, maintenance,
upgrades, trips, etc.), but it's fun.

### Electronics

I've been fiddling around with embedded electronics lately. I have several project ideas on the back burner that I
putter on from time to time. This includes working with embedded controllers (lately, Arduino).

### Other Stuff

I spend a lot of time hanging out with friends. This usually involves going to various bars or restaurants, going
go-karting, hitting up amusement parks, partying, going to the movies, and whatever random shenanigans we come up with.

## Blog

You can get a more up-to-date snapshot at what I'm currently doing by reading my [blog](http://blog.baf.cc/). I make a
conscious effort to update it periodically with whatever I'm working on.
